-The main challenge I encountered this assignment was the 
general setup and usage of the unittests. Unittesting is a relatively new
concept to me, so knowing how to format the tests and how many tests to
write was the main issue I had. I beleive that the more confident I get,
and the more practice I have, the less of an issue this will become.

-I think that the requirements were pretty fair and straightforward. 
However, it would have helped since this was the first use of unittests
if there was a specific number of tests required, or a certain format,
just so I can be a bit more prepared for what is expected. That being said,
figuring it out on my own did add a bit of a challenge.

-I did not really have any challenges with the tools. The unittest's 
functionality was relatively straight forward and the assigment itself was
not very complex, so I did not have much difficulty in that regard.

-In order to determine that I had sufficient test cases, I wanted to make
sure that each criteria was covered at least once. Meaning, I had to cover
every possible combination (Scalene and right, scalene and not right, 
isosceles and right, isosceles and not right, equilateral and not right, and
not a triangle). I knew I was done when every unit test worked and I ran the 
function using random numbers as well and had no issue.
